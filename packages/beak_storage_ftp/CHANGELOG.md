# Changelog

All notable changes to this package are documented in the
[root changelog](https://github.com/SimonErich/beak/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md). The
`beak_*` packages are versioned in lockstep, so one entry there covers all of
them.

## 0.9.0 - Unreleased

The FTP storage driver, and the worked example of writing one.

New in 0.9.0: `MKD` directory creation shares the transfer path's rooting, so a relative `baseDir` works on servers that are not chrooted.

Beak is pre-1.0: the API is not frozen, the wire format is. See
[Upgrading](https://simonerich.github.io/beak/start-here/upgrading/) for how to
move between versions.
